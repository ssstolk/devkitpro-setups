# devkitpro-setups
Repository for backups of devkitPro setups used in my software development projects.
To learn more about devkitPro, and its license, please visit their [official website](https://devkitpro.org) and their [Github account](https://github.com/devkitPro).


Note that a number of environment variables are required by devkitPro setups for them to work properly:
* **DEVKITARM** - /c/devkitPro/devkitARM
* **DEVKITPRO** - /c/devkitPro
* **Path** - c:\devkitPro\msys\bin

(As you can tell, the devkitPro toolchain is installed on the root of my C drive.)
